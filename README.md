# TGSSreanalysis_CASA-CAPTURE
This version of CAPTURE pipeline is result of my radio astronomy master's research project http://dspace.iiti.ac.in:8080/jspui/handle/123456789/2936 at IIT I in collab with NCRA-TIFR. The default settings provided allows to immediately image TIFR GMRT SKY SURVEY (TGSS) 150 MHz data with very good dynamic range and accurate flux or any other legacy GMRT data at band 2. This pipeline contains custom settings 'as is' developed during research project else it is identical to https://github.com/ruta-k/uGMRT-pipeline (the vers which works with CASA 5.5 or higher but not 6) . However the settings if understood properly can be easily implemented in newer versions by the users.
The achievement is data reduction of TGSS at 150 MHz is significantly challenging manually, this ready to use pipeline reduces the effort and limits time to hours as well as proves to be accurate even over existing TGSS ADR1 release.
It is hoped that this will encourage researchers towards open science with CAPTURE pipeline for both legacy and upgraded GMRT data as they custom fit to their own projects as in our case TGSS.
