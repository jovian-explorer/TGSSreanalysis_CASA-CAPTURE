# TGSSreanalysis_CASA-CAPTURE
This version of CAPTURE pipeline is result of my radio astronomy master's research project at IIT I in collab with NCRA-TIFR. The default settings provided allows to immediately image TIFR GMRT SKY SURVEY (TGSS) 150 MHz data with very good dynamic range and accurate flux or any other legacy GMRT data at band 2.
